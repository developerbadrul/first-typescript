### 1. The Significance of Union and Intersection Types

Union and Intersection Types are fundamental concepts in TypeScript

Union Types: In TypeScript, union types allow to define a variable that can hold values of multiple types. For example, if you have a function that can accept a string or a number, you can use a union type.

Here I give an example:

// Example: Union Types
type Result = number | string;

function publishResult(result: Result): void {
    console.log(result);
}

publishResult(42);         
publishResult("success");  

Intersection Types: Intersection types allow to combine multiple types into a single type.

here I give an example:


// Example: Intersection Types
interface Person {
    name: string;
    age: number;
}

interface Student {
    id: number;
    department: string;
}

type DeveloperInfo = Person & Student;

const developer: DeveloperInfo = {
    name: "Md B Alam",
    age: 30,
    id: 1234,
    department: "level 2 developer"
};
